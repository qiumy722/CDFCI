# CDFCI

CDFCI (Coordinate Descent Full Configuration Interaction) is a modern, efficient solver for the ground-state electronic structure problem in quantum chemistry. It is implemented in modern C++17 with support for large-scale sparse wavefunctions and adaptive compression strategies.

## ✨ Overview

CDFCI reformulates the full configuration interaction (FCI) eigenvalue problem as a large-scale unconstrained nonconvex optimization problem. It solves this problem using adaptive coordinate descent with deterministic compression.

Key features:

* Coordinate-wise update of Slater determinants
* Adaptive compression via `z_threshold`
* Deterministic and memory-aware wavefunction storage
* Optional support for OpenMP (multi-threaded)

## 🚀 Getting Started

For Python workflows and advanced scripting usage, see the [Python Interface User Manual](./PYTHON_INTERFACE_USER_MANUAL.md).

### Clone and Build

Clone this repository using the URL shown under its GitHub **Code** button,
then run from the project root:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --parallel
```

Eigen is discovered on the system or fetched automatically during configure.
The following executables will be generated in `build/bin`:

* `cdfci`: single-threaded version
* `cdfci_omp`: OpenMP-enabled version
* `xcdfci`: for excited states
* `xcdfci_omp`: OpenMP-enabled excited-state version
* `optorbfci`: for orbital rotation and compression
* `cdfci_tools`: auxiliary utilities

You can build a specific executable with, for example,
`cmake --build build --target cdfci`. The main configuration options are:

* `CDFCI_ENABLE_OPENMP=ON|OFF`: build OpenMP variants when available (default `ON`)
* `CDFCI_BUILD_PYTHON=ON|OFF`: build the `_cdfci` Python extension (default `OFF`)
* `BUILD_TESTING=ON|OFF`: build regression-test executables (default `ON`)
* `CDFCI_ARCH_FLAGS="..."`: add optional architecture-specific compiler flags

Install with `cmake --install build --prefix /path/to/prefix`. The legacy
Makefile remains available for existing workflows, but CMake is the supported
and CI-tested build path.

### Requirements

* C++17 compiler (GCC ≥ 9, Clang ≥ 10, or ICC)
* CMake 3.20 or newer
* [Eigen3](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org) (fetched automatically if unavailable)
* OpenMP (optional)

### Run on BSCC-A2 (single core)

From the project root on the login node, compile once, then submit the included
Slurm shell script:

```bash
source /public3/soft/modules/module.sh
module load gcc/12.2
module load cmake/3.28.0
cmake -S . -B build_a2_gcc12 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF
cmake --build build_a2_gcc12 --target cdfci --parallel 2
sbatch run_cdfci_serial.sh
```

This runs `examples/demo_input_energy_correction.json` and writes the iteration
table and final energy to `cdfci_serial_<job-id>.out`. The example reports every
1000 iterations with energy correction enabled. To use another input, pass its
path as an argument; set `solver.cdfci.energy_correction.enabled` to `false` to
skip the correction calculation (the correction columns then show zero):

```bash
sbatch run_cdfci_serial.sh examples/demo_input_cdfci.json
```

The job expects `build_a2_gcc12/bin/cdfci` by default. Set `CDFCI_APP` at
submission time if the executable is elsewhere.

## 📥 Input Format (JSON)

The solver accepts a JSON input file. Example:

```json
{
    "hamiltonian": {
        "type": "molecule",
        "molecule": {
            "fcidump_path": "/path/to/FCIDUMP",
            "threshold": 0.0
        }
    },
    "solver":{
        "type": "cdfci",
        "cdfci": {
            "num_iterations": 150000,
            "report_interval": 10000,
            "z_threshold": 0,
            "z_threshold_search": false
        }
    },
    "max_memory": 0.005
}
```

More examples, including [a full documentation for input and output](./examples/README.md), can be found in the `examples/` directory.

An optional [streaming energy correction](./doc/energy_correction.md) reports
projected diagonal energy estimates during CDFCI, using the existing sparse
wavefunction without an additional Hamiltonian application.

## 🧪 Testing

To compile and run regression tests:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --parallel
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

Example systems and expected energies are provided in `regression_tests`.

---

## 📊 Reproducibility

The `examples/` and `papers/` directories contain all scripts and input files to reproduce published results. Requires Python and [PySCF](https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf) to generate FCIDUMP files.

The companion perturbative energy-correction paper has a separate
[one-click Slurm workflow](./experiments/energy_correction/README.md) covering
all five experiments in its numerical-results plan:

```bash
sbatch experiments/energy_correction/run_all.sbatch
```
